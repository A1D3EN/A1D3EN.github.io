        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I’m just someone who’s really into cars. I’ve always liked how they look, how fast they go, and just the overall design of them. I think there’s something cool about how every car has its own style and personality. Whether it’s just looking at them, learning about different models, or thinking of my own ideas, cars are something I never really get tired of. That’s a big reason why I wanted to start something like AIDRIVE — to mix that interest with creativity and do something with it. Here are some cars that stared my interest. <cars></cars>
